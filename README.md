## What is that
This is a basic example how you can use yandex map API

## How to use

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Pitmov/geofeedback.git
$ cd geofeedback
$ npm install
$ cd nodejs
$ node server.js
```
After that start your favorite webserver, open html/index.html and try! Good luck! I hope everything is working :)
